# Digital Bank Springboot Application | Backend

## Project Description
This application is a replica of a virtual bank application that shows the different operations that could be done in a digital bank such as CRUD of the customers and their accounts. It is build with Springboot, a framework that is designed to simplify the development of Java-based applications, offering RESTful services and interacts with relational databases for persistent storage.

## Technologies Used
- Java :
- Springboot:
- Spring Data JPA:
- MySQL:
- Maven:
- For the frontend part, we used Angular (https://github.com/mohamed-ameziane/Digital-Bank-Frontend)

## Architecture
The application type is monolithic...

## Features and Functionalities

### CRUD Operations

The application provides complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for managing customer and account data through RESTful web services.

**Customer Operations:**

* **Create:** Add a new customer via `POST /customers`.
* **Read:**
  * Get all customers: `GET /customers`
  * Get customer by ID: `GET /customers/{id}`
  * Search customers (with filtering): `GET /customers/search`
* **Update:** Modify an existing customer using `PUT /customers/{customerId}`.
* **Delete:** Remove a customer via `DELETE /customers/{id}`.

### Business Logic

The business layer encapsulates the core logic for handling banking operations. It ensures:

* **Data integrity** when updating or deleting customer and account information.
* **Validation** of account operations such as transfers, debits, and credits.
* **Consistency** in transaction history and account balances.
* **Exception handling** for operations on non-existent accounts or insufficient funds.
